# BlxDashboard:<br>Using Web Bluetooth to access LTX Data Loggers #
** A PWA (Progressive Web APP) for accessing LTX Data Loggers with BLE, LTE-M. LTE-NB, EDGE, EGPRS, Satellite, ...  

__Web Bluetooth__ is an official __W3C API__, integrated in most modern Browsers (like Chrome, Edge, Opera, …)
on Android and Windows, making it easy to connect to Bluetooth devices with one single software. 
Runs on Desktops/Notebooks (Windows), as well as on Smartphones/Tablets (Android and Windows)! 

_(Unfortunately the Web Bluetooth API is still not fully available on Safari (iOS), but workarounds exists, using a Wrapper-App with a WebViewer. And apparently the API will soon be fully available on iOS too)._

It is even not necessary to install any 'native APP'. The complete software is nothing else, than a _„Simple Web page“_, that can work even offline (if installed).

### Installation as PWA (Progressive Web APP) (for offline use):

Automatic installation:
- Simply Click ` Install APP `

Fallback (manuall installation):
- On Android smartphones: Select `Add to home screen`
- On desktop PC: In the browser, select the 3-dot menu '&vellip;' (on the right side): `Stream, save, share` -> `Install as APP`
